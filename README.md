# LendMoney

## Project Description

#### What?
LendMoney Financing is a crowd funding platform based on the ethereum blockchain. It allows people to lend funds for an idea, charity, or start-up business. It is fully decentralized and secure. This platform is unique as it does not rely on banks to lend funds, but instead facilitates easy and secure lending between users in a peer-to-peer fashion. This solution is not tokenized in an effort to make loans as simple as possible. We offer a simple portal that  facilitates these loans, based on the React framework. 

#### Why?
Often times working with a bank on getting a loan can be a long and tedious process, halting the production of new inventions or companies. The process involves a large amount of legal and financial paperwork that is prone to human error and is not completely transparent. LendMoney aims to solve this issue by facilitating a sure-fire way for individuals to confidently loan money to others, negating the need for a traditional bank. While other solutions such as this exist within the current market they are heavily tokenized. LendMoney is not tokenized in an attempt to make the process as easy to use as possible.


#### How?
LendMoney Financing is built on top of the Ethereum platform. The LendMoney smart contract will be deployed. A web app will be built for the user to interact with the LendMoney smart contract. This will be using the web3.js interface along with React. Users will be able to login with with their public and private key. Users designate the addresses they want to interact with, ensuring that no customer data is involved in an attempt to conserve privacy.
